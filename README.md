# liver-mtnn-ontox-opensource
MTNN for the prediction of 28 in vitro endpoints related to liver toxicity and function, as well as specific to drug-induced liver injury (DILI). The in vitro endpoints include molecular initiating events (MIEs) and key events (KE) leading to DILI, as well as others that potentially influence liver functions (e.g. substrates of transporters expressed in the liver or phospholipidosis).


These models were trained (exclusively) on public data sources as part of Bayer's collaboration in the European ONTOX project.
